mouse pressed

imageview.setonmousepressed() (e->) {

	pixelreader pr = imageview.getimage().getPixelreader();
	Color col = pr.getColor(e.get x and e.get y);
	
	System.out.println("Hue: " + col.getHue());
	System.out.println("saturation: " + col.getSAT());
	System.out.println("Brightness: " + col.getBrightness());


	
}

Could bring in logic to get rid of green from the image.
Try get the clicked on component as clear as possible
Have to handle multiple components

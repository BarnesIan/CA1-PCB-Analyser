 PCB image file selection and display = 5% </
 Black-and-white image conversion and display = 10% </
 Union-find implementation = 10% </
 Onscreen identification of all selected components (using rectangles) = 10% </
 Ordered sequential components numbering (onscreen labelling) = 10%
 Estimating/counting of components in overall image (total and by type) = 8% 4
 Reporting the size of individual disjoint sets (in pixel units) = 7% </
 Colouring disjoint sets in black-and-white image (both sampled and random colours) = 10%
 Image noise reduction and outlier management = 10%
 JavaFX GUI = 5% </
 JUnit Testing = 5%
 JMH Benchmarking of key methods = 5%
 General (overall completeness, structure, commenting, logic, etc.) = 5%

idea: When clicking image store the selected color and create a disjoint array of those colors. put them on the single disjoint set screen,
then add any new ones to that and color them the same color there stored as and if statement to say if not that color then white
